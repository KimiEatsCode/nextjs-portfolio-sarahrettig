Plan: Add Tools & Technologies Filter to Projects Page
======================================================

Overview: Add a `tools` frontmatter field to all project MDX files and a second
filter select dropdown on the projects page to filter by tools/technologies.

Todos:
  1. [pending] Add `tools` list field to the Project document type in contentlayer.config.js
  2. [pending] Add `tools:` frontmatter list to all 14 MDX files in content/projects/, extracting from existing markdown body
  3. [pending] Extract unique tools list in app/projects/page.tsx and pass to ProjectFilter
  4. [pending] Add tools select dropdown and dual-filter logic to app/projects/project-filter.tsx

------------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT

- The projects page (app/projects/page.tsx) already has a topic filter via
  app/projects/project-filter.tsx
- Tools/technologies currently only exist as unstructured markdown body content
  in each MDX file
- We need to promote them to structured frontmatter and add a second filter dropdown

------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES

1. Add `tools` field to Contentlayer schema

In contentlayer.config.js, add a `tools` field to the Project document type
(same pattern as `topics`):

    tools: {
      type: "list",
      of: { type: "string" },
    },

2. Add `tools` frontmatter to all 14 MDX files

For each file in content/projects/, extract the tools from the existing
"## Tools & Technologies" markdown section and add them as a `tools:` list
in the frontmatter. Example for personal-hopebucket-react.mdx:

    tools:
      - React
      - Bootstrap CSS
      - CSS and HTML
      - Javascript
      - Lottie Animations
      - Figma

3. Extract and pass tools data in the projects page

In app/projects/page.tsx, add logic to extract unique tools from all projects
(mirroring the existing topics extraction on lines 50-60) and pass them to
ProjectFilter.

4. Update ProjectFilter component with a second select dropdown

In app/projects/project-filter.tsx:

  - Accept a new `tools` prop (same shape as `topics`: { label, value }[])
  - Add a `selectedTool` state
  - Update the filtering logic to apply both topic and tool filters (intersection)
  - Render a second <select> dropdown for tools alongside the existing topic dropdown
  - Update the "Displaying X projects" count to reflect both filters
