## Project Overview

As the Wordpress Admin & Graphic Designer, I designed marketing campaign materials such as social media assets, landing page and printed flyers for the Dislocated Worker Grant campaign. Working with other departments on the creating design assets, I created a collaborative design board in Canva to serve as the branding and style guide for campaign materials. My designs were also used in advertising assets for the METRO Philadelphia newspaper and the Philaworks Member newsletter. The landing page with Facebook marketing tags on the CareerLink website resulted in over 70 inquiries into the DWG program.
