## Project Overview

I utilized Adobe Illustrator's AI generation tools to turn hand drawn sketches into vector art graphics and to assist in generating ideas for cute animal characters for my punch needle sewing pouch project. 
In Illustrator, I sketched a dog graphic using a wacom pen, then with the graphic selected, I entered a prompt instructing AI to create a black outline, kawaii style version of the dog using the dog sketch as an "reference image".
