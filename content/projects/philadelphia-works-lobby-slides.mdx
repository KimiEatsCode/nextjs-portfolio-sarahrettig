## Project Overview

Each month I designed 4-6 slides for the lobby. I used Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and/or Canva to create and edit graphics. The Communications Director would give feedback and approve the lobby slides in Canva. The slides were seen by staff, board members, and guests such as the U.S. Secretary of Labor representative and city officials.
