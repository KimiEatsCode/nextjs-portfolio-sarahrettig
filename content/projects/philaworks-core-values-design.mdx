## Project Overview

I was the lead graphic and print designer on the Core Values project that ran parallel to the Brand Refresh project. I worked with the communications director and a small committee to come up with visuals and edit the copy. I made the final artwork into vector graphics including a vector version of the company logo that could be easily reused and resized for any project.
