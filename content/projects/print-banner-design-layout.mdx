## Project Overview

I was the graphic and print designer on a project to refresh the design of 7 foot banners for the CareerLink Centers in Philadelphia. I worked with the project coordinator to communicate with the printer and deliver the banners. I designed 2 versions to present to stakeholders. The goal was to refresh a decade old design with current training offerings and modern photos for banners to be shipped to career centers in Philadelphia. 

## Design Considerations

My new banner design uses Adobe Stock photos that highlight recovery occupations from the PA CareerLink Recovery Occupations list. A Recovery Occupation is a career that pays a living wage and has future growth of opportunities. I assisted with the copy for the banner. At the top I made sure to highlight that CareerLink offers training for modern careers with programs like apprenticeships and jobs in demand classes.

## Tools & Technologies

- Adobe Indesign
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Acrobat
- Adobe Stock Photos

## Results

- Old design printed by CareerLink Manager
- New design printed by FastSigns 
- Banners shipped to each career center
