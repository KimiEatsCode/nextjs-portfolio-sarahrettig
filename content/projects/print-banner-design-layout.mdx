## Project Overview

I was the graphic and print designer on a project to refresh the design of 7 foot banners for the CareerLink Centers in Philadelphia. I worked with the project coordinator to communicate with the printer and deliver the banners. I designed 2 versions to present to the Careerlink Comms manager and PhilaWorks Comms manager. The goal of the project was to refresh a decade old design with a new design that highlighted current training offerings. I prepared large format print files for the printer and had banners shipped to career centers in Philadelphia. 

## Design Considerations

My new banner design uses Adobe Stock photos that highlight recovery occupations from the PA CareerLink Recovery Occupations list. A Recovery Occupation is a career that pays a living wage and has future growth of opportunities. I assisted with the copy for the banner. At the top I made sure to highlight that CareerLink offers training for modern careers with programs like apprenticeships and jobs in demand classes.

## Tools & Technologies

- Adobe Indesign
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Acrobat
- Adobe Stock Photos

## Results

- Old design printed by CareerLink Manager
- New design printed by FastSigns 
- Both Banners shipped to career centers

## Lessons Learned

My design research revealed that current modern banner designs incorporate geometric shapes, iconography such as social media icons and photos of people less dressed up and more casual/relatable. Every design project adds to updating my design sensibility and this one did that. Even though banners with the old design were also printed and shipped, I see the experience as successful one because it led me to creating design boards in Canva for future projects where I collaborated with CareerLink on design assets instead of working in parallel. For siloed companies like PhilaWorks and CareerLink, programs like Canva and Figma help get people on the same page and files.
