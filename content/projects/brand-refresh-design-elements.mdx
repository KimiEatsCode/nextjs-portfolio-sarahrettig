## Project Overview

As the Marketing Web Graphic Designer, I collaborated with a remote contract designer to create new brand elements as part of the department's brand refresh project. I utlized Canva, a collaborative design application, so we could contribute and review ideas asynchronously since we had two different schedules. We met on zoom to discuss ideas, share design inspiration, and settle on our final design deliverables. I created a final power point presentation outlining the inspiration behind the new design element for social, internal communications, and mailings.
