## Project Overview

I designed social media ads to promote their Roadtrip Nation hub for Philadelphia. Roadtrip Nation is a national non-profit that among many other things offers online community as mini-websites that focus on youth career content specific to a location. I designed multiple social media ad versions in sizes to fit popular platforms including iHeart radio which have much different sized ads than Facebook or Linkedin. I created a style guide on Canva with colors and photos so that other departments could create marketing materials as well without me needing to assist them.
