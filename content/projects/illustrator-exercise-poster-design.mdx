## Project Overview
I was inspired by the flat graphic design trend in design at the time. I used the trend as inspiration to design an infographic on the benefits of exercse. I traced an Adobe stock photo of an atheltic woman running. I used the vector graphic I made as the reference for generative AI to render new versions displaying other popular exercises such as stretching, mediation, and strength training. The AI generated versions of artwork needed to be edited. Using my professional vector editing design skills, fixing up the AI iterations was no problem and a design challenge I enjoyed completing. I used Chat GPT for writing descriptions of exercises to fit a consistent format and tone of voice.
