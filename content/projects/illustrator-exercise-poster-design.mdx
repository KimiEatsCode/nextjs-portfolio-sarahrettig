## Project Overview
I was inspired by the flat graphic design trend in social media at the time. I used the trend as inspiration to design an infographic on the benefits of exercse. I also wanted to make use of my wacom drawing pad. I traced a stock photo of a atheltic woman running. I used the vector graphic as the reference for generative AI to render new versions displaying other popular exercises. AI generated versions needed to be edited to fix mistakes or ai misinterpretations. Using my professional vector editing design skills, fixing up the AI iterations was no problem and a design challenge I enjoyed completing.
