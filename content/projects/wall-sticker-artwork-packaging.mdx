## Project Overview
As the print production artist at a home decor startup, Lot 26 Studio in San Francisco, I assisted in the creation of wall art designs using stock graphics and following branding guidelines. I prepared artwork for printing overseas and tested prototypes in-house. The wall sticker collections were presented to big box stores and sold in Target and Bed Bath & Beyond. 

## Key Responsibilities

- Artwork preparation for overseas printing
- Prototype testing in-house
- Sales sheet design for retail distribution
- Two brands: ADD-HERES (peel-and-stick stickers) and Adorn (vinyl decals)

## Tools & Technologies

- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe InDesign
- Print production workflows

## Branding & Design

There were two brands, ADD-HERES and Adorn. ADD-HERES was peel and stick stickers and Adorn was vinyl decals that can be burnished, pressing and smoothing the sticker onto the wall surface to ensure it applies properly and removes any air bubbles or creases. The art director handpicked the color palettes and chose out artwork from stock photos and vector graphics.
